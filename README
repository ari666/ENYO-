We're going to use GIT for the project,

learn to generate your keys, it's the same as linux: ssh-keygen 
(or refer to http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)


We're going to be using an open graphics library:

Choices I have in mind are:
	- http://geosoft.no/graphics/
	- http://ogre4j.sourceforge.net/
        - http://java.net/projects/jogl/

If you want to add on, change this readme ;)
